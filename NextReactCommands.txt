Backend experience in PHP database operations and small funtions.

Proficient in CSS and Bootstrap CSS. Bootstrap for its pre-designed components and responsive grid system.

Organized components using a modular approach, employing directories, PropTypes for type checking, and leveraging component libraries like Material-UI. Emphasized container/presentational component pattern for maintainability.
